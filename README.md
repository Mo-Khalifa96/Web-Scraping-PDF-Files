# Web Scraping PDF Files

## About The Program
**This is my first attempt at web scraping using the Requests and Beautiful Soup libraries. The following code is a simple program for accessing 
the web and extracting links to PDF files from any given web page (provided it references links to PDF files anywhere on the page). I have included 
three versions of the code: the first simply searches for and extracts any pdf links to be found, the second applies filters to ensure these links 
are valid and active, and the third makes the code more generally applicable, allowing the user to copy and paste any web page they like (instead of 
using only one sample web pages as in versions 1 and 2).**

## Executing the Program 
**You can quickly access and execute the program by clicking on the link below. The link will immediately direct you to the 
Jupyter notebook version of the program, which will enable you to interact with the code and run different parts of it to 
reproduce the output. Further, you can run each version of the program individually. As mentioned, the third version prompts 
the user for a web address, and so you can run and re-run it multiple times to try scraping different web pages, provided they 
contain links to pdf files. Note, importantly, the first two cells must be executed first before running any of the cells below 
them. The first cell installs the necessary Python libraries whilst the second imports them, making them ready for use. Feel 
free to test the program in whatever way you like.**
